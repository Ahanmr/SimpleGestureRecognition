# Simple Gesture Recognition
A gesture recognition project in Python.

# Note
This project has been implemented in 2 ways. They are:
1. Simple Image Processing - In this method I did not use any machine learning, neural networks or anything like that. To know more about it read the <a href="http://github.com/evilport2/simplegesturerecognition/README_ip.md">README_ip.md</a>.
2. Convolutional Neural Network. - I used a neural network which was trained on the EMNIST letters dataset. This neural network is used to predict which gesture is made. To more read <a href="http://github.com/evilport2/simplegesturerecognition/README_cnn.md">README_cnn.md</a>.

# Got a question?
If you have any questions that are bothering you please contact me on my <a href = "facebook.com/dibakar.saha.750">facebook profile</a>. Just do not ask me questions like where do I live, who do I work for etc. Also no questions like what does this line do. If you think a line is redundant or can be removed to make the program better then you can obviously ask me or make a pull request.
